# Library-Management-Project.

About the Project;
1. Creates a database structure for a Library Management System, which helps manage books, authors, members, librarians, and book borrowings.

2. Defines six tables:

   .Authors: Stores information about book authors (like their names).

   .Books: Stores details about books in the library including title, ISBN (unique book code), publication year, and how many copies are available.

   .BookAuthors: A bridge (or join) table that links books and authors, because one book can have multiple authors, and one author can write many books (many-to-many relationship).

   .Members: Stores library member details such as name, email, phone number, and registration date.

   .Librarians: Stores librarian details who manage the lending process.

   .Borrowings: Tracks which member borrows which book, when it was borrowed, when itâ€™s due, and when it was returned. It also records which librarian handled the borrowing.

3. Sets up relationships and constraints:

  .  Primary keys (`PRIMARY KEY`) uniquely identify each record in a table.

  . Foreign keys (`FOREIGN KEY`) link tables together to maintain data integrity, for example, each borrowing record must be linked to an existing book, member, and librarian.

  . Unique constraints (like on `ISBN` and emails) prevent duplicate entries for those fields.

4. Handles data integrity:

    If a book or author is deleted, related records in the `BookAuthors` or `Borrowings` tables are automatically removed (`ON DELETE CASCADE`).

    If a librarian is deleted, borrowing records remain but the librarian reference is set to NULL (`ON DELETE SET NULL`).



 In summary:

This script builds the backbone of a Library Management database. It lets you store, organize, and maintain:

.Who wrote which book,
.What books are available,
. Who the library members are,
.Who the librarians are,
. And who borrowed what book and when.
